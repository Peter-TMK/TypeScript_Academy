// Exercise 1: Basic Tuple Declaration and Initialization
// Declare a tuple named person that contains a string (name) and a number (age).
// Initialize it with the values "Alice" and 30. Log the person tuple to the console.

// Exercise 2: Tuple with Multiple Types
// Declare a tuple named product that contains a string (product name), number (price),
// and boolean (in stock). Initialize it with appropriate values and log the product tuple to the console.

// Exercise 3: Access and Modify Tuple Elements
// Using the person tuple from Exercise 1, log each element to the console separately.
// Then, change the age to 31 and log the updated person tuple to the console.

// Exercise 4: Tuple with Optional Elements
// Declare a tuple named rectangle that contains two required number elements (width and height)
// and one optional number element (color code).
// Initialize it with values 50, 100, and log it to the console.
// Then, add a color code and log the updated rectangle tuple to the console.

// Exercise 5: Function Returning Tuple
// Create a function named getEmployee that returns a tuple containing a
// string (employee name) and a number (employee ID).
// Call the function and log the returned tuple to the console.

// These exercises will help you practice declaring, initializing, accessing,
// modifying tuples, and working with optional elements in TypeScript.
