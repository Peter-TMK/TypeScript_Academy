// Exercise 1: Abstract Shape Class
// Define an abstract class named Shape with the following:

// An abstract method area() that returns a number.
// An abstract method perimeter() that returns a number.
// Then, create two derived classes Circle and Rectangle:

// Circle should have a property radius and implement the area() and perimeter() methods.
// Rectangle should have properties width and height and implement the area() and perimeter() methods.
// Create instances of both classes and log their area and perimeter.

// Exercise 2: Abstract Animal Class
// Define an abstract class named Animal with the following:

// An abstract method makeSound() that returns a string.
// A method move() that returns a string indicating the movement of the animal.
// Then, create two derived classes Dog and Cat:

// Dog should implement the makeSound() method to return "Bark".
// Cat should implement the makeSound() method to return "Meow".
// Create instances of both classes and log their sounds and movement.

// Exercise 3: Abstract Payment Class
// Define an abstract class named Payment with the following:

// An abstract method processPayment(amount: number): string.
// Then, create two derived classes CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment:

// CreditCardPayment should implement the processPayment() method to return a
// message indicating the payment was processed via credit card.
// PayPalPayment should implement the processPayment() method to return a
// message indicating the payment was processed via PayPal.
// Create instances of both classes and log the result of processing payments.

// Exercise 4: Abstract Appliance Class
// Define an abstract class named Appliance with the following:

// An abstract method turnOn() that returns a string.
// An abstract method turnOff() that returns a string.
// Then, create two derived classes WashingMachine and Refrigerator:

// WashingMachine should implement the turnOn() and turnOff() methods to return appropriate messages.
// Refrigerator should implement the turnOn() and turnOff() methods to return appropriate messages.
// Create instances of both classes and log the result of turning them on and off.

// Exercise 5: Abstract Transport Class
// Define an abstract class named Transport with the following:

// An abstract method start() that returns a string.
// An abstract method stop() that returns a string.
// Then, create two derived classes Car and Bicycle:

// Car should implement the start() and stop() methods to return appropriate messages.
// Bicycle should implement the start() and stop() methods to return appropriate messages.
// Create instances of both classes and log the result of starting and stopping them.
