// Exercise 1: Static Property Initialization
// Define a class named Counter with the following:

// A static property count initialized to 0.
// A constructor that increments the count property by 1 each time a new instance of the class is created.
// Create three instances of the Counter class and log the value of Counter.count to the console.
// Verify that it shows the expected count value.

// Exercise 2: Static Method for Utility
// Define a class named MathUtilities with the following:

// A static method square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.
// A static method cube that takes a number as an argument and returns its cube.
// Call the static methods square and cube directly using the class name and log the results to the console.

// Exercise 3: Static Method with Static Property
// Define a class named Library with the following:

// A private static property books initialized to an empty array.
// A static method addBook that takes a book title as an argument and adds it to the books array.
// A static method getBooks that returns the list of books in the books array.
// Add a few books using the addBook method and retrieve the list of books using the getBooks method. Log the results to the console.

// Exercise 4: Static Counter in a Class
// Define a class named User with the following:

// A static property userCount initialized to 0.
// A constructor that increments the userCount property by 1 each time a new instance of the class is created.
// A static method getUserCount that returns the current value of userCount.
// Create a few instances of the User class and call the getUserCount method to log the total number of users created.

// Exercise 5: Static Configuration Class
// Define a class named Config with the following:

// A private static property settings initialized to an empty object.
// A static method setSetting that takes a key and value as arguments and sets the key-value pair in the settings object.
// A static method getSetting that takes a key as an argument and returns the corresponding value from the settings object.
// Set and retrieve various settings using the setSetting and getSetting methods, and log the results to the console.
