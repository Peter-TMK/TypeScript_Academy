// 1. Class and Object Creation
// Create a Person class with properties for name and age.
// Add a method introduce() that logs a message like "Hi, I'm [name] and I'm [age] years old."
// Create two instances of the Person class and call the introduce() method on each.

// 2. Inheritance and Method Overriding
// Create a Vehicle class with properties make, model, and year.
// Add a method getDetails() that returns a string with the vehicle's details.
// Create a Car class that extends Vehicle and adds a numDoors property.
// Override the getDetails() method in the Car class to include the number of doors.
// Instantiate the Car class and call the getDetails() method.

// 3. Encapsulation and Private Properties
// Create a BankAccount class with a private property _balance.
// Add methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) to modify the balance.
// Add a method getBalance() that returns the current balance.
// Ensure that the balance cannot be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.

// 4. Polymorphism
// Create a Shape class with a method getArea() that returns 0.
// Create two subclasses, Rectangle and Circle, that override the getArea() method to calculate the area of the rectangle and circle, respectively.
// Write a function that accepts an array of Shape objects and logs the area of each shape.

// 5. Static Methods and Properties
// Create a MathUtils class with a static method square(number) that returns the square of a number.
// Add a static property PI with the value 3.14159.
// Use the MathUtils.square() method and the MathUtils.PI property to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.
