// Exercise 1: Basic Getter and Setter
// Define a class named Product with the following properties:

// private _name: string
// private _price: number
// Create getter and setter methods for both properties.
// Ensure that the setter for _price validates that the price is a positive number.
// Test the class by creating an instance and using the getters and setters.

// Exercise 2: Complex Validation in Setter
// Define a class named User with the following properties:

// private _username: string
// private _password: string
// Create getter and setter methods for both properties.
// Ensure that the setter for _password validates that the password is at
// least 8 characters long and contains at least one number and one uppercase letter.
// Test the class by creating an instance and using the getters and setters.

// Exercise 3: Getter with Computed Property
// Define a class named Rectangle with the following properties:

// private _width: number
// private _height: number
// Create getter and setter methods for both properties.
// Additionally, create a getter method area that returns the computed area of the rectangle.
// Test the class by creating an instance and using the getters and setters.

// Exercise 4: Combining Multiple Getters and Setters
// Define a class named BankAccount with the following properties:

// private _accountNumber: string
// private _balance: number
// private _ownerName: string
// Create getter and setter methods for all properties.
// Ensure that the setter for _balance validates that the balance is non-negative.
// Test the class by creating an instance and using the getters and setters.

// Exercise 5: Full Name Getter and Setter
// Define a class named Employee with the following properties:

// private _firstName: string
// private _lastName: string
// Create getter and setter methods for both properties.
// Additionally, create a getter method fullName that returns the concatenated first and last name,
// and a setter method fullName that accepts a full name string and splits it into first and last name.
// Test the class by creating an instance and using the getters and setters.
