// 1. Generic Queue Implementation
// Implement a generic Queue<T> class that follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.
// The class should include methods for enqueuing items, dequeuing items, checking if the queue is full,
// and checking if the queue is empty.
// Test the Queue class with different data types, such as numbers, strings, or objects,
// to ensure it works correctly with all types.

// 2. Type-Safe Generic Linked List
// Create a generic LinkedList<T> class that allows you to add and remove nodes from the list.
// Each node should store a value of type T and a reference to the next node.
// Implement methods for adding a node to the end, removing a node from the start, and checking if the list is empty.
// Test the LinkedList with various types, including custom objects.

// 3. Generic Map with Constraints
// Develop a generic Map<K extends string, V> class that stores key-value pairs where the keys are strings.
// The class should provide methods to set, get, and delete key-value pairs, as well as check if a key exists.
// Ensure that the class can handle any value type V, and test it with different types of values, including arrays and objects.

// 4. Generic Stack with Max Size Constraint
// Modify the Stack<T> class to include a generic constraint that limits the stack to accept only numbers or strings as elements.
// Implement methods to push, pop, check if the stack is empty, and check if the stack is full.
// Test the class with valid and invalid types to ensure the constraint is enforced properly.

// 5. Generic Dictionary with Key Constraints
// Implement a generic Dictionary<K extends string | number, V> class that allows you to store key-value pairs where
// the keys can only be strings or numbers. Provide methods to add, retrieve, update, and remove entries in the dictionary.
// Test the Dictionary class with both string and number keys, ensuring that it handles key collisions and updates correctly.
