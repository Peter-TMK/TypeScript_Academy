// Exercise 1: Calculate Area
// Create a function named calculateArea that can calculate the area of different shapes.
// The function should be able to handle the following cases:
// Two arguments: radius (number) for calculating the area of a circle.
// Two arguments: width (number) and height (number) for calculating the area of a rectangle.
// One argument: side (number) for calculating the area of a square.

// Exercise 2: Join Arrays and Strings
// Create a function named join that can join arrays or strings:
// One argument: an array of strings, returning a single concatenated string.
// Two arguments: two arrays of numbers, returning a single array with elements of both arrays concatenated.

// Exercise 3: Find Element
// Create a function named findElement that can find an element in different data structures:
// Two arguments: an array of numbers and a number, returning the index of the number in the array.
// Two arguments: a string and a character, returning the index of the character in the string.

// Exercise 4: Combine Values
// Create a function named combine that can combine values of different types:
// Two arguments: two numbers, returning their sum.
// Two arguments: two strings, returning their concatenation.
// Three arguments: two numbers and a string, returning a string in the format "number1, number2: string".

// Exercise 5: Parse Data
// Create a function named parseData that can parse different types of data:
// One argument: a JSON string, returning the parsed object.
// Two arguments: a string and a delimiter, returning an array of substrings.
// Instructions:
// Define the overloaded function signatures as described in each exercise.
// Implement the function logic to handle different signatures.
// Test each function with different inputs to ensure they work as expected.
// Ensure that the TypeScript compiler correctly checks the types based on the overloaded signatures.
