// Exercise 1: Skip Multiples of 3:
// Write a function named skipMultiplesOfThree that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the continue statement to skip numbers that are multiples of 3.
// Return a new array containing the remaining numbers.
// Test the function with different arrays of numbers.

// Exercise 2: Count Non-Empty Strings:
// Write a function named countNonEmptyStrings that takes an array of strings as a parameter.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the continue statement to skip empty strings.
// Count the number of non-empty strings.
// Return the count.
// Test the function with different arrays of strings.

// Exercise 3: Skip Vowels in a String:
// Write a function named skipVowels that takes a string as a parameter.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the string.
// Use the continue statement to skip vowel characters (a, e, i, o, u).
// Return a new string containing only the consonants.
// Test the function with different strings.

// Exercise 4: Filter Even Numbers Using While Loop:
// Write a function named filterEvenNumbers that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.
// Use a while loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the continue statement to skip odd numbers.
// Return a new array containing only the even numbers.
// Test the function with different arrays of numbers.

// Exercise 5: Skip Negative Numbers in a Do-While Loop:
// Write a function named skipNegativeNumbers that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.
// Use a do-while loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the continue statement to skip negative numbers.
// Return a new array containing only the non-negative numbers.
// Test the function with different arrays of numbers.
