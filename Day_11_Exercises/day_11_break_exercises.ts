// Exercise 1: Find the First Even Number:
// Write a function named findFirstEven that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the break statement to terminate the loop when the first even number is found.
// Return the first even number.
// Test the function with different arrays of numbers.

// Exercise 2: Calculate the Sum Until a Threshold:
// Write a function named sumUntilThreshold that takes an array of numbers and a threshold value as parameters.
// Use a while loop to iterate through the array.
// Sum the numbers until the sum exceeds the threshold value and use the break statement to terminate the loop.
// Return the sum.
// Test the function with different arrays and threshold values.

// Exercise 3: Stop at a Specific Product:
// Write a function named findProductByName that takes an array of product objects (with name and price properties)
// and a product name as parameters.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the array.
// Use the break statement to terminate the loop when the specified product is found.
// Return the product object.
// Test the function with different arrays and product names.

// Exercise 4: Exit a Nested Loop:
// Write a function named findNumberInMatrix that takes a 2D array (matrix) of numbers and a target number as parameters.
// Use nested for loops to iterate through the matrix.
// Use the break statement to exit both loops when the target number is found.
// Return the position (row, column) of the target number.
// Test the function with different matrices and target numbers.

// Exercise 5: Count Characters Until a Stop Character:
// Write a function named countUntilStopChar that takes a string and a stop character as parameters.
// Use a for loop to iterate through the string.
// Use the break statement to terminate the loop when the stop character is encountered.
// Return the count of characters before the stop character.
// Test the function with different strings and stop characters.
