// Exercise 1: Print Numbers from 1 to n Using do...while:
// Write a function named printNumbers that takes a number n as a parameter.
// Use a do...while loop to print all numbers from 1 to n.
// Test the function with different values of n.

// Exercise 2: Calculate Sum of Positive Numbers:
// Write a function named sumPositiveNumbers that keeps asking the user to input positive numbers.
// Use a do...while loop to calculate the sum of all positive numbers entered.
// Stop asking for input when a negative number is entered and return the sum of positive numbers.
// Test the function with different sets of inputs.

// Exercise 3: Guess the Number Game:
// Write a function named guessTheNumber that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
// Use a do...while loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess the number.
// Continue looping until the user guesses the correct number and then print a congratulatory message.
// Test the function to ensure it works correctly.

// Exercise 4: Generate Multiplication Table:
// Write a function named multiplicationTable that takes a number n as a parameter.
// Use a do...while loop to print the multiplication table for n from 1 to 10.
// Test the function with different values of n.

// Exercise 5: Reverse a String:
// Write a function named reverseString that takes a string str as a parameter.
// Use a do...while loop to reverse the string.
// Return the reversed string.
// Test the function with different strings.
